# Image Creation Practice Question

## Objective
Practice using an image library to create images from scratch without external image files.

## Task
Create a program that generates a 400×300 pixel image with the following requirements:

1. **Background**: Fill with a gradient (e.g., blue to white, top to bottom)
2. **Shapes**: Draw at least three different shapes:
    - A red circle in the center
    - A yellow rectangle in the top-left corner
    - A green triangle in the bottom-right corner
3. **Text**: Add text that displays "Generated Image" in the center
4. **Save**: Export the final image as `output.png`

## Hints
- Consider using libraries like:
  - **Python**: Pillow (PIL), OpenCV
  - **JavaScript**: Canvas API, Fabric.js
  - **C#**: System.Drawing, SkiaSharp
- Start with basic shapes before adding gradients or effects
- Test your color values (RGB tuples) before using them

## Success Criteria
- Image renders without errors
- All shapes are visible and properly positioned
- Text is readable
- File saves successfully
